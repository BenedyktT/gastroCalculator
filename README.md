This project allows you to

## Prerequisites

after cloning this project you need to install necessary dependencies of the server and client as well

### `npm i && cd client && npm i`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This command will use concurrently to run server and client (server will be run on port 5000 )

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

For testing endpoints I've used supertest

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
